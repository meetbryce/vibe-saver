# Website Maintenance Rules

When creating new HTML pages in the `docs/` directory, ensure the Beam Analytics tracking script is included in the `<head>` section.

The script is:
<script
  src="https://beamanalytics.b-cdn.net/beam.min.js"
  data-token="e77f8e0f-1a18-4575-ac9b-976fc07091f1"
  async
>
</script>
